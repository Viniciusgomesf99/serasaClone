In this project, we will build a front-end clone using a website:

## Header

    On the header HTML structure we will use a header section which contains a div with image for logo and <ul> tags for menu, other div to buttons for sign in/on.

    This section will contain an <img> for the left side of screen, a <h3> tag for the right side title and a lot of <p> for the explanations. Right side also includes a inputbox type="search" for CNPJ consult and button for search action.

    in the footer of right side section we have a CTA button.
